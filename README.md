MovieFocus
==========

MovieFocus is a Minecraft mod that allows for a more flexible usage of depth of field and focus in Minecraft movies. It patches supported shaderpacks so that they work together with the mod.

Without the [GLSL shaders mod](http://shadersmod.net/) and a supported depth of field shaderpack, the mod won't activate.
